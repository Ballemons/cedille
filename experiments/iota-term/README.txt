Higher-order lambda encoding of untyped lambda calculus terms, based on parametricity.

-- ctrm.ced:  Church-encoded (non-dependent) untyped lambda calculus terms, and related functions
-- trm.ced:   parametric such terms (trm1), and the ultimate type (trm), for which we can later prove induction
-- ctors.ced: definitions of constructors for the untyped lambda calculus terms
-- ind.ced:   derivation of induction for trm
