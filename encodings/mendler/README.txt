C.ced -- define datatype with non-dependent elimination, including notion of algebra
D.ced -- now define a version of the datatype supporting dependent elimination
Ind.ced -- using the development in D.ced, derive induction for the type C.
Hom.ced -- using induction, prove that inAlg (defined in C.ced) is an initial algebra
