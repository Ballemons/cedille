To install Cedille version 1.0:

1. check out a copy of the Iowa Agda Library (probably best to do this
   in some other directory):

   svn co https://svn.divms.uiowa.edu/repos/clc/projects/agda/ial

2. create a symbolic link in the Cedille directory, pointing to the
   IAL directory.  The link should be named "ial".

3. Now you can run "make" in the Cedille directory, and this should
   compile the cedille executable (which should appear in the Cedille
   directory).

4. Follow the directions at the top of cedille-mode.el in the Cedille
   directory, to set up Cedille mode within emacs.  Then you can open
   files like lib/bool.ced within emacs and hit "Meta-s" to process
   them (if all goes well, the mode should change to "Cedille navi"
   and you can then type "h" for help).

To edit Agda source files for Cedille:

-- since Agda 2.5.x now uses a library system, you need to copy the
   libraries and defaults files to your .agda/ directory in your home
   directory.  Edit the libraries file to give the paths to the three
   libraries needed for Cedille (one for the IAL, one for some generic
   code for the parser, and one for the Cedille sources proper).
