# Provisional Standard Library

We are providing a few source files that capture some useful
repeated developments we have been doing, but they are not
yet properly organized into a nice standard library.  We 
will probably make backwards-incompatible changes to this
which we will not reflect in the semantic versioning for 
Cedille.  This is a good spot for pull requests!
