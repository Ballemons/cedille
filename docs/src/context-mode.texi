@chapter Context mode

Context mode for Cedille allows the user to see the context of the currently selected node, making it easy to find and make use of all bound symbols. To enter context mode, select a node and press @command{C} and you will open up the context mode buffer and jump to it. If you just want to open the context mode buffer (but not jump to it), press @command{c} instead.

@chapter Customization

You can access customization options for context mode in the Cedille Context customization group. To access customization options in general, press @command{M-x customize} and then type the desired customization group into the search bar.
