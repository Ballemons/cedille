@cindex context buffer

The context buffer for Cedille allows the user to see the local variables in scope for the currently selected node. To display the context buffer, select a node and press @command{C}; this will open the context buffer and jump to it. If you just want to open the context buffer (but not jump to it), press @command{c} instead.

The context buffer has several built-in features to organize data:
@itemize @bullet

@item
Sort entries alphabetically or by binding position

@item
Filter entries according to common properties. Only one filter may be active at a time.

@item
Show or hide shadowed variables
