@chapter Architecture of Cedille

Cedille is implemented in around 13kloc of elisp + Agda.  There is an
emacs Cedille mode for reading and writing Cedille code using
@ref{unicode shortcuts}.  Most importantly, from Cedille mode one can
request that the Cedille backend process the current Cedille source
buffer, and enter Cedille navigation mode.  In Cedille navigation
mode, a rich amount of type information computed from the backend is
available and can be viewed node by node of the abstract syntax tree
for the text of the buffer.  One navigates this tree using individual
keystrokes (in Cedille navigation mode) like p and n.  One can also
issue interactive commands, even use a beta-reduction explorer.
@xref{cedille mode commands} There are several @ref{extra buffers}
available to display information about the current node (the inspect
buffer), current typing context, meta-variable solutions, and summary
information for the source file.

Additionally, one can request that Cedille compile a given source
buffer and its dependencies to Cedille Core, a much more minimalistic
core type theory lacking many of the nice features of Cedille,
especially spine-local type inference.  @code{core} contains an implementation
of Cedille Core in Haskell.  There is a specification of Cedille Core
@uref{https://github.com/astump/cedille-core-spec, here}.

@section Spans

The frontend (i.e., the emacs mode) sends request to the backend in a
simple text format.  The backend replies with @emph{spans}, which
consist of a starting and ending character position in the file, a
name for the node, and a list of attribute-value pairs.  The inspect
buffer, which one views with keystroke @key{i} when a span is
highlighted (with @key{p}), shows this information.  Some of the
attribute-value pairs are suppressed by default, because they are
intended just for use by the frontend.  You can see them if you wish
by changing the setting of the Cedille Mode Debug customization
variable; to do this, use keystroke @key{$} from Cedille navigation
mode to see customization options, or do @command{customize-group} @code{cedille}.

Spans for file @code{F} are cached in a @code{F.cede} file written to
a @code{.cedille} subdirectory of @code{F}'s directory.  Spans are
stored and transmitted to the frontend in JSON format.  Hence, one
can easily read the span data directly -- but you will find that it
is very verbose and much easier to understand through the emacs mode.

The @code{se-mode} (``structured editing'', though it is really just
structured navigation) part of the elisp code is concerned with
processing the spans and assembly an abstract syntax tree based on
span containment.  @code{se-mode} is generic, and can be used as the
basis for structured navigation for other languages.  @code{se-mode}
was proposed, designed, and implemented by U. Iowa undergraduate Carl
Olson, before the current Cedille implementation began.
