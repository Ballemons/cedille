6 Context mode
**************

Context mode for Cedille allows the user to see the context of the
currently selected node, making it easy to find and make use of all
bound symbols.  To enter context mode, select a node and press 'C' and
you will open up the context mode buffer and jump to it.  If you just
want to open the context mode buffer (but not jump to it), press 'c'
instead.

   Context mode has several built-in features to organize data:

   * Sort entries alphabetically or by binding position

   * Filter entries according to common properties.  Only one filter may
     be active at a time.

   * Show or hide shadowed variables

7 Controls
**********

'a/z'
     Sort all entries alphabetically from a-z/z-a

'd/u'
     Sort all entries according to binding position in parse tree
     (descending/ascending)

'e'
     Filter out entries that do not have an '‚âÉ' symbol

'E'
     Filter out entries that are not literal statements of Œ≤-equality

'f'
     Clear current filter so all entries are shown

's'
     Toggle display of shadowed variables

'c/C'
     Close the context mode window

'h'
     Open information page for context mode

9 cedille-mode options
**********************

The options file resides in ~/.cedille/options and consists of a list of
options, each on its own line, with a terminating period (".").  The
available options are:

'import-directories "/path/to/dir"'
     This specifies a directory where Cedille will search for imported
     files.  Any number of directories may be listed, each on its own
     line.  They will be searched after the current directory, in the
     order they are listed.  Currently, it is not recommended to have
     two files with the same name.

'no-cede-files'
     This option disables the Cedille backend's use of .cede files.

10 Minor modes for cedille
**************************

Cedille has three minor modes that provide information about the file:

* Menu:

* inspect mode::                Provides information about the currently selected node
* context mode::                Displays the types and kinds of all variables in the scope of the selected node
* summary mode::                Displays the types and kinds of every top-level entity in the file

11 Inspect mode
***************

Inspect mode for Cedille provides basic information about a node.  To
enter inspect mode, select a node and press 'I' and you will open up the
inspect mode buffer and jump to it.  If you just want to open the
inspect mode buffer (but not jump to it), press 'i' instead.

   Inspect mode may contain the following pieces of information:

   * The sort of entity that the node represents

   * The type or kind of the node

   * The file location in which the entity represented by the node is
     defined

12 Controls
***********

'i/I'
     Close the inspect mode window
