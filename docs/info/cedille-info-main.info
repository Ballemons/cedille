6 Context mode
**************

Context mode for Cedille allows the user to see the context of the
currently selected node, making it easy to find and make use of all
bound symbols.  To enter context mode, select a node and press 'C' and

want to open the context mode buffer (but not jump to it), press 'c'
instead.

   Context mode has several built in features to organize data:

   * Sort entries alphabetically or by binding position

   * Filter entires according to common properties.  Only one filter may
     be active at a time.

   * Show or hide shadowed variables
